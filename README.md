## üß† What QTRigdoppler does

QTRigdoppler keeps track of satellites and their transponders. It handles multiple tasks: <br/>
 1) Tracking satellites and calculating the doppler shifts of their used frequencies.<br/>
 2) Update VFOs of a connected ICOM IC-910 (and IC-9700) for fully automatic frequency tracking.<br/>
 3) Depending on the transponder type: FM/SSB Voice or FM/SSB Data, the software determines the best tracking approach.<br/>
 4) Rotators can be connected to sync their position with the current satellite.<br/>
 5) A websocket option enable integration into software like [Zenith](https://github.com/magicbug/Zenith).<br/>
 6) There is an optional map you can use to plot the satellites position<br/>

## üåì Choose your style
QTRigdoppler now comes with many themes you can choose from. A brief selection of some themes:

# üìãüîÑ‚è≥ Changelog
- Based on K8DP Doug Papay rigdoppler (@K8DP_Doug)  
- Adapted by EA4HCF Pedro Cabrera (@PCabreraCamara)  
- Extended and modified by DL3JOP Joshua Petry (@dl3jop)

Contributions in this repo by:
- Joshua, DL3JOP
- Peter, 2M0SQL
 
DL3JOP modifications:
- Removed hamlib

- Various smaller changes and additions
- Added binaries

2M0SQL Modifications:
- Changed to PySide
- Implemented Websocket support, Cloudlog/Wavelog integration, pass recording, gps position polling, auto TLE updates
- Added satellite database (doppler.sqf) downloading with merge or replace options from oscarwatch.org.
- Added frequency pause/resume feature: pause frequency updates while keeping rotator tracking for manual frequency control on newer satellites.
- Added help files

Feel free to report bugs or submit pull requests with your additions to the codebase!
    
    
# üéØ Roadmap
  - Adding support for FT-8xx radios. Same approach: serial driver, although that will add additional reworks in the doppler tracking loop to account for two radios
  - Separate GUI and tracking class
  - Refactor tracking loop:
    - no global F0/I0 variables
